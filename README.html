<h1 id="insuring-baseball-cards-in-zero-knowledge">Insuring baseball
cards in zero-knowledge</h1>
<p>In this project we will build a system for proving possession and
details about a baseball card in a public purchase ledger
<em>without</em> revealing which card you’re talking about. Yes this is
silly. Extra credit for this homework is to find a better metaphor for
the code I already have written.</p>
<p>Our goal is to familiarize ourselves with the workflow of writing
zero-knowledge proofs in the <a
href="https://github.com/arkworks-rs/">arkworks</a> ecosystem. We will
learn how to build zero-knowledge circuits, prove openings to
cryptographic commitments, and prove membership in a Merkle tree. The
purpose of this exercise is to make you feel comfortable playing with
new ideas in arkworks. It is a massive framework, with lots of features,
as well as weird sharp corners, so jumping right in might just be the
best way to get started.</p>

<p>If you’re familiar with other languages and want a crash course in
Rust, I like <a
href="https://fasterthanli.me/articles/a-half-hour-to-learn-rust">this</a>
tutorial. Beyond this, I don’t have specific recommendations. This <a
href="https://gist.github.com/noxasaxon/7bf5ebf930e281529161e51cd221cf8a">meta-guide</a>
has lots of resources for people of all incoming skill levels. Pick
whatever suits your current comfort level and play with that. I’m
looking for feedback here, so keep in mind what tutorials you tried and
liked and disliked.</p>
<p>For this assignment, it will be helpful to be comfortable with:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a
href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/error/result.html"><code>Result</code></a>
type (including <code>unwrap()</code> and the <code>?</code>
operator)</li>
<li><a

<li><a
href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch10-02-traits.html">Traits</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We strongly encourage you to use an IDE for this project. Whatever
IDE you pick (e.g., Visual Code, Sublime, Neovim, Emacs), we recommend
you install the <code>rust-analyzer</code> add-on. This will show you
errors in the source code itself, which will save you from having to go
back and forth between your editor and your <code>cargo test</code>
output. It will also let you do language-level things like renaming
variables, jumping to definitions, etc.</p>
<h2 id="navigating-code-and-documentation">Navigating code and
documentation</h2>
<p>The canonical documentation site for all Rust crates is <a
href="https://docs.rs">docs.rs</a>. If it exists, the docs are on
docs.rs. But Arkworks is not the best documented library, and sometimes
it is easiest to just use your IDE to jump to the definition of a struct
or a trait in order to find out what methods it exposes. This will be
your superpower.</p>
<h2 id="getting-help">Getting help</h2>
<p>Rust has a very large online community, and there are tons of
channels to get help. Very few people actually know anything about
Arkworks, so if you want answers, you should probably stick with
language-level questions.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://discord.gg/rust-lang">Rust Discord</a></li>
<li><a href="https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/">Rust Zulip</a></li>
<li>Unofficial Rust Matrix Chat - <code>#rust:matrix.org</code></li>
<li>Unofficial Rust IRC - <code>##rust</code> on <a
href="https://libera.chat/">LiberaChat</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Standard messaging etiquette applies:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Do not ask to ask a question. Just ask.</li>
<li>State your problem as clearly as possible. Ideally, reduce your
problem to a minimum failing testcase, i.e., a small snippet of valid
code that exemplifies your problem, and fails in the same way your real
code fails. The <a href="https://play.rust-lang.org">Rust Playground</a>
is a nice place to to construct a minimum failing testcase and share a
link to.</li>
<li>Do not spam the channel. It may take a while to get an answer. If it
has been a long time since you asked and you’ve gotten no response, a
single “bump” message is appropriate.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: If you are reading this again because you are hitting a
problem, at this point you may wish this assignment was not in Rust. The
alternative was one of a few special purpose language for SNARKs. They
are slightly simpler. But there is no community to ask for help at
all.</p>
<h1 id="cryptographic-preliminaries">Cryptographic preliminaries</h1>
<p>A quick overview of the cryptographic components we use.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>We model our public ledger as a Merkle tree. See <a
href="https://pangea.cloud/docs/audit/merkle-trees">here</a> for a short
overview on Merkle trees and tree membership proofs (aka
<em>authentication paths</em>).</li>
<li>The leaves of our Merkle tree are <em>cryptographic
commitments</em>. We denote by <code>c = Com(val; com_rand)</code> a
commitment to the value <code>val</code>, using the <em>commitment
randomness</em> <code>com_rand</code>. We say that
<code>(val, com_rand)</code> is the <em>opening</em> of <code>c</code>.
In order to be secure, a commitment scheme must be:
<ul>
<li>Binding - This means that a commitment cannot be opened to a
different value other than what was originally committed to. Concretely,
if <code>c = Com(val; com_rand)</code> for some
<code>val, com_rand</code>, and someone produces
<code>val', com_rand'</code> such that
<code>c = Com(val'; com_rand')</code>, then it must be the case that
<code>val' = val</code> and <code>com_rand' = com_rand</code>.</li>
<li>Hiding - This means that a commitment should say nothing about what
is committed. In other words, for any choices of <code>val, val'</code>
it should be impossible for an adversary to tell whether a given
commitment <code>c</code> commits to <code>val</code> or
<code>val'</code> (assuming the com_rand is sampled uniformly).</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>An example of a secure commitment scheme is
<code>Com(val; com_rand) = Hash(com_rand || val)</code> where
<code>Hash</code> is a cryptographically secure hash function with
certain properties (i.e., it is not vulnerable to length extension; so
pick anything besides MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256 or SHA-512).</p>
<p>Recall that the proof systems we use take an arithmetic circuit
representing a computation that has private inputs, aka the
<em>witness</em>, and public inputs. Some inputs will be constants,
i.e., fixed by the circuit. For Groth16, there is a circuit-specific
<em>proving key</em> (aka evaluation key) used by the prover, and a
circuit-specific <em>verification key</em>. Your task is to assemble
circuits that realize commitments, Merkle trees, etc. into a particular
application.</p>
<h1 id="intro">Intro</h1>
<p>In this assignment, you will build a toy zcash-esque scheme for
manipulating commitments in a Merkle tree. In this case, the objects
will be baseball cards.</p>
<p>A baseball card is a tuple which contains
<code>(purchase_price, serial_num)</code>, i.e., the dollar amount that
the card was bought for, and the serial number printed on it. There is a
public ledger, represented as a Merkle tree, whose leaves are all the
known authentic baseball cards, appearing in order of time of purchase.
In order to hide the potentially sensitive values of these cards, we
make the leaves <em>card commitments</em>, i.e., values of the form
<code>Com((purchase_price, serial_num); com_rand)</code>.</p>
<pre><code>      G = root
    /   \
  E      F
 / \    / \
A   B  C   D

where
    A = Com((amt1, serial1); com_rand1)
    B = Com((amt2, serial2); com_rand2)
    C = Com((amt3, serial3); com_rand3)
    D = Com((amt4, serial4); com_rand4)</code></pre>
<p>Now suppose every card is a collector’s item. They are quite rare.
Lloyd’s of Linden (a New Jersey-based “insurance” company) is giving out
a certificate of authenticity to anyone who can prove possession of a
card. According to Lloyd’s a collector <em>possesses</em> a card if and
only if they can prove that they know the card commitment’s opening, and
that that commitment is in the Merkle tree. Proving this to Lloyd’s has
some complications, though.</p>
<p>The first issue is privacy. Obviously, simply revealing this
information outright would leak both the position of the card in the
tree (i.e., when the collector got the card) and the amount contained in
the card. Neither of these are strictly necessary for Lloyd’s to know.
The solution here is to instead use a zero-knowledge proof: “I know an
<code>amount</code>, <code>serial_num</code>, and <code>com_rand</code>
such that <code>Com((amount, serial_num); com_rand)</code> appears in
the Merkle tree.”</p>
<p>The second issue (which is caused by our solution to the first issue)
is double-counting. As stated, there’s no way for Lloyd’s to tell if
someone sent them 50 proofs for the same exact card. It should be the
case that every card gets at most 1 certificate of authenticity. The
solution we will use is to force a collector to reveal the serial number
when presenting a proof of membership. In other words, the
zero-knowledge proof statement is now “I know an <code>amount</code> and
<code>com_rand</code> such that
<code>Com((amount, serial_num); com_rand)</code> appears in the Merkle
tree”, where <code>serial_num</code> is known to both the prover and
verifier.</p>
<p>Our final proof statement has two steps: proving knowledge of an
opening to a commitment, and proving membership in a Merkle tree. We
will step through how each of these works in the Arkworks zero-knowledge
proof ecosystem.</p>
<h1 id="assignment">Assignment</h1>
<p>A partial implementation of our statement above is given in
<code>src/constraints.rs</code> in the
<code>PossessionCircuit::generate_constraints</code> method. Of the
three tests in that file, currently 2 fail.</p>
<p>There’s plenty of other files in <code>src/</code> as well. Peak
around and see what they’re doing. Hopefully the comments, as well as
your code-jumping IDE will give you an idea of what’s happening. For
example <code>src/lib.rs</code> has a nice native code example in
<code>test_merkle_tree</code>. In this example, we create a bunch of
random cards, and then make those leaves in a Merkle tree (using a
Pedersen hash function). We then check that a claimed path for some leaf
corresponds to a given root. In this assignment we will do this, and
more, in zero-knowledge.</p>
<p>The first two problems will require you to add some code to the
<code>PossessionCircuit::generate_constraints</code> method.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-submit">How to submit</h2>
<p>Once you’ve done the problems (and optional extra credit), you will
<strong>submit your homework as follows:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Make a text file called <code>extra_credit.txt</code> and put it in
the <code>src/</code> folder. In the text file, tell me how much (if
any) of the extra credit you did (steps 1-4). I will not check your
extra credit if you do not write this.</li>
<li>Zip the <code>src/</code> folder and upload the zip file to ELMS. I
should be able to unzip your submission into a fresh repo, and run
<code>cargo test</code> and all the <code>cargo run</code> commands to
check that everything is correct.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Do NOT zip the entire assignment folder.</strong> I do not
want 40MB of garbage partial build files.</p>
<h2 id="problem-1-proving-commitment-opening-in-zk">Problem 1: Proving
commitment opening in ZK</h2>
<p>We want to make sure that <code>PossessionCircuit</code> actually
proves knowledge of the opening to the card commitment. To that end
<code>card_soundness</code> test in <code>src/constraints.rs</code>
checks that <code>PossessionCircuit</code> is not satisfied if you give
it any random opening to a card commitment. The reason the test
currently fails is because no commitment opening check is performed in
<code>gneerate_constraints</code>.</p>
<p>Fill in the code that goes below <code>CHECK #1</code>. This code
should:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>compute the commitment of <code>card_var</code>,</li>
<li>enforce that the resulting commitment equals the claimed
commitment.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once this is done, you can run <code>cargo test</code>. You will know
you got it right when the <code>card_soundness</code> test passes. The
<code>tree_soundness</code> test will still fail though (see next
problem).</p>
<p><em>Hint 1:</em> <code>card_var</code> already has a way of computing
the commitment. Look at <code>src/card.rs</code>.</p>
<p><em>Hint 2:</em> You need the circuit to enforce that two things are
equal. Take a look at the <a
href="https://docs.rs/ark-r1cs-std/0.4.0/ark_r1cs_std/eq/trait.EqGadget.html#method.enforce_equal"><code>EqGadget::enforce_equal</code></a>.
Most types we care about implement <code>EqGadget</code>.</p>
<h2 id="problem-2-proving-merkle-tree-membership-in-zk">Problem 2:
Proving Merkle tree membership in ZK</h2>
<p>We want to make sure that <code>PossessionCircuit</code> actually
proves that the claimed card commitment appears in the Merkle tree. To
that end, the <code>tree_soundness</code> test in
<code>src/constraints.rs</code> checks that
<code>PossessionCircuit</code> is not satisfied if you give it any
random Merkle root. The reason the test currently fails is because no
tree membership check is performed in
<code>generate_constraints</code>.</p>
<p>Fill in the code that goes below <code>CHECK #2</code>. This code
should:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>compute the root node of the Merkle authentication path,</li>
<li>enforce that the resulting value equals the publicly known Merkle
root.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once this is done, ensure the <code>tree_soundness</code> test
passes. Now, <code>cargo test</code> should be all successes.</p>
<p><em>Hint:</em> <code>auth_path_var</code> already has a way of
computing the root. See <a
href="https://github.com/arkworks-rs/crypto-primitives/blob/4b3bdac16443096b26426673bff409d4e78eec94/src/merkle_tree/constraints.rs#L191"><code>here</code></a>.</p>
<h2 id="problem-3-groth16-proofs">Problem 3: Groth16 proofs</h2>
<p>Up until now we’ve just been symbolically executing the circuits. In
reality, we want collectors to compute their proof and give it, along
with their serial number, to Lloyd’s. This involves a few steps:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Lloyd’s will generate the proving key for
<code>PossessionCircuit</code>, and their Pedersen hash constants, and
publish both.</li>
<li>Collectors will prove ownership of their card and send the proof and
commitment back to Lloyd’s.</li>
<li>Lloyd’s will check the proofs with respect to the public input</li>
</ol>
<p>This will correspond to our files in the <code>src/bin/</code>
directory. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>src/bin/gen_params.rs</code> — This will generate the hashing
parameters as well as the proving and verifying key of our circuit. It
will write these to <code>pedersen_params.bin</code>,
<code>possession_proving_key.bin</code>, and
<code>possession_verifying_key</code>, respectively.</li>
<li><code>src/bin/prove.rs</code> — This will use the above data, plus
some secret knowledge about a card and its position in the Merkle tree,
to create a Groth16 proof. It writes the proof and the card’s serial
number to <code>possession_proof.bin</code> and
<code>possession_revealed_serial.bin</code>, respectively.</li>
<li><code>src/bin/verify.rs</code> — This will use the revealed serial
number public knowledge of a Merkle root to verify the Groth16 proof
computed above.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the sake of simplicity, we have hard-coded a Merkle tree in
<code>src/util.rs</code>. <strong>We will assume everyone has a copy of
the same Merkle tree.</strong> The Merkle root, which we will pass to
the prover and verifier, is represented in base32 as
<code>f5pj64oh3m6anguhjb5rhfugwe44ximao17ya3wgx1fbmg1iobmo</code>.</p>
<h3 id="problem-3.1-generate-params">Problem 3.1: Generate params</h3>
<p>The first step to deploying a proof system is to generate all the
public values. This is includes: the details of the hash function we’re
using, the Groth16 proving key, and the Groth16 verifying key.
Generating the Groth16 proving/verifying keys of a circuit is a little
bit easier than actually proving something. You’re not proving anything
yet, you’re just defining the structure of the proof. So, in
<code>gen_params.rs</code>, rather than constructing a circuit which is
actually satisfied, we only need to construct a circuit <em>with the
same shape</em> as the circuit we want satisfied. Concretely, this means
that we can take a <code>PossessionCircuit</code> and fill it with
arbitrary values, so long as they have right type/size as the values we
want to use. Note: we still must give it the correct constants, because
those values are baked into the circuit and cannot change in the
future.</p>
<p>Your task is to make up some arbitrary values and stick them into the
<code>PossessionCircuit</code> definition in
<code>src/bin/gen_params.rs</code> in the appropriate place. These
locations are marked with <code>todo!()</code>. Once you’re done, the
following command should succeed:</p>
<pre><code>cargo run --release --bin gen_params</code></pre>
<p>This will panic and abort until all <code>todo!()</code>s are filled
in.</p>
<p>Tip: if you remove the <code>--release</code> flag, proving will be
slower, but it will also be easier to debug, as the proof compiler will
be able to catch when you’re trying to prove something that’s false.</p>
<p><em>Hint:</em> The field element type <code>F</code> implements <a
href="https://docs.rs/ark-ff/0.3.0/ark_ff/trait.UniformRand.html#tymethod.rand"><code>UniformRand</code></a>.
It also implements <a
href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/default/trait.Default.html"><code>Default</code></a>.</p>
<h3 id="problem-3.2-prove-possession">Problem 3.2: Prove possession</h3>
<p>This is the meat of the proof system. We must use the proving key,
known public constants, and private inputs in order to generate a proof
of possession of a baseball card. In this case, the private info
(“witnesses”) is the commitment randomness for committing to the card
and the Merkle authentication path proving membership in the tree. The
proof will also be accompanied by whatever public inputs are necessary.
In this case, the prover is revealing the card’s serial number. The
proof will be saved in <code>possession_proof.bin</code> and the
now-public serial will be saved in
<code>possession_revealed_serial.bin</code>.</p>
<p>Your task is to fill in the <code>todo!()</code> items in
<code>src/bin/prove.rs</code> in order to make the proving procedure
succeed. There’s only one line of computation here, and a few lines of
filling in values. Remember, the things that go into the
<code>PossessionCircuit</code> here are not like before: they MUST be
values that make the circuit succeed. Once you’re done, the following
command should succeed:</p>
<pre><code>cargo run --release --bin prove -- \
    pedersen_params.bin \
    possession_proving_key.bin \
    f5pj64oh3m6anguhjb5rhfugwe44ximao17ya3wgx1fbmg1iobmo</code></pre>
<p>(note the <code>\</code> just tells your terminal that the command
continues on the next line.) If you want to check if you’re proving an
invalid statement, remove the <code>--release</code> flag. This will
save you lots of headaches for the next problem. If you’re trying to
verify a false statement, you’re gonna have a bad time.</p>
<p><em>Hint:</em> You will need to make a <a
href="https://github.com/arkworks-rs/crypto-primitives/blob/4b3bdac16443096b26426673bff409d4e78eec94/src/merkle_tree/mod.rs#L338">Merkle
authentication path</a>. You already have the <code>tree</code>.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> Look at how <code>public_inputs</code> are generated
in this file. Everything ends up being represented as field elements in
order for our proof system to work. You’ll have to change this line in
the extra credit.</p>
<h3 id="problem-3.3-verify-possession">Problem 3.3 Verify
possession</h3>
<p>The final step is for Lloyd’s to verify the proofs that have been
generated. Lloyd’s verifier will use the known, public Merkle root and
the claimed serial number in order to determine whether the Groth16
proof is valid.</p>
<p>Verification is probably the simplest of the steps. For this problem,
just fill out the single <code>todo!()</code> in `src/bin/verify.rs. You
will have to serialize the public input to field elements, just like the
prover did. Once you’re done, the following command should succeed, and
output “Proof verified successfully”:</p>
<pre><code>cargo run --release --bin verify -- \
    possession_verifying_key.bin \
    possession_proof.bin \
    possession_revealed_serial.bin \
    f5pj64oh3m6anguhjb5rhfugwe44ximao17ya3wgx1fbmg1iobmo</code></pre>
<p><em>Hint:</em> Look how <code>prove.rs</code> defined
<code>public_inputs</code>.</p>
<h2 id="extra-credit-revealing-purchase-price">Extra credit: Revealing
purchase price</h2>
<p>Lloyd’s has changed their policy. They now require everyone to reveal
the purchase price of their card. You will have to modify the entire
proof system to have the purchase price as a public value. This is a lot
of work! You’ll need to:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>update <code>PossessionCircuit</code> to <em>input</em> (rather than
<em>witness</em>) the purchase price.</li>
<li>update <code>src/bin/prove.rs</code> to output the purchase price in
addition to everything else</li>
<li>update <code>src/bin/verify.rs</code> to read this tuple and use it
as public input for verification</li>
</ol>
<p>In this extra credit, you do just that:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Copy <code>src/constraints.rs</code> to
<code>src/constraints_showprice.rs</code> and put
<code>mod constraints_showprice</code> in <code>lib.rs</code>. Rename
the <code>PossessionCircuit</code> to
<code>PossessionShowPriceCircuit</code>. Modify
<code>PossessionShowAmtCircuit</code> to use
<code>card_purchase_price</code> as a public input rather than a
witness. This should not require updating tests.</li>
<li>Copy <code>src/bin/gen_params.rs</code> to
<code>src/bin/gen_params_showprice</code>. Make it use
<code>PossessionShowPriceCircuit</code>. Its output files should not
clash with the normal <code>gen_params.rs</code>, so make it output the
proving/verifying keys to
<code>possession_showamt_proving_key.bin</code> and
<code>possession_showamt_verifying_key.bin</code>. You don’t need to
change the Pedersen params filename. They are the same.</li>
<li>Copy <code>src/bin/prove.rs</code> to
<code>src/bin/prove_showprice.rs</code>. Make it use
<code>PossessionShowPriceCircuit</code>. It should take in the file
produced in the previous step. The prover should output the purchase
price to <code>possession_purchase_price.bin</code>, and its proof to
<code>possession_showprice_proof.bin</code>. The rest can stay the same
if you want.</li>
<li>Copy <code>src/bin/verify.rs</code> to
<code>src/bin/verify_showprice.rs</code>. Make it use
<code>PossessionShowPriceCircuit</code>. It should take in the proof
generated above, as well as all the public inputs, PLUS the new public
input in <code>possession_purchase_price.bin</code> (you’ll have to edit
the command line arg parsing routine for this). It should use the
purchase price as public input for verification.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you’re done, the verify command should output “Prove verified
successfully.”</p>
